      <h1>Juan Marcelo Martin</h1>
      <p>
        I became passionate about technology recently and finished a Coding Bootcamp in December of 2019, where I became
        a
        Full Stack Developer.
        I think I have a very good grasp of Javascript and during this last year I've been working with Angular 9 and
        React and I feel comfortable with both, but if I had to point out a strength of mine it would be my work ethics.
        I'm very commited to anything I do and the idea of learning constantly is very exciting to me.
        I'm looking for a frontend developer positon where I can use either Angular or React, a Node Js backend position
        or a full-stack position with a combination of those technologies.
        I'm also more than happy to try and learn new technologies.
